# Language - Questions 
This AI answers questions inputted by the user related to the topics in the training corpus. Using [Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tf-idf-weighting-1.html), [Inverse Document Frequency](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/inverse-document-frequency-1.html), and a [query term density measure](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/term-frequency-and-weighting-1.html) this Question Answering model identifies which documents and passages are most relevant to the input question.
