I started with a straightforward Sequential CNN model using 1 convolution layer with max-pooling, no hidden layers and no dropout. This gave an accuracy rate of around 88%. Increasing the number of filters from 8 to 16 increased the accuracy to around 93%. Adding in a second convoluition layer and dropout to avoid overfitting on the training data brought the accuracy up to around 96%. I added 2 hidden layers and experimented with tweaking the parameters. I experimented with different values for number of filters and kernel size for the convolution layers, and for the size and number of hidden layers, generally sticking to powers of 2. After some trial and error, I ended up with a model that typically produces around 98% accuracy on the test set.

I noticed that adding multiple convolution or hidden layers seems to improve the model's accuracy. I also noticed that repeating the convolution layer twice before doing max-pooling seemed to yield better results than using max-pooling after each convolution layer. Additionally, as the model's performance improved, it began to get harder to make additional gains. After reaching around 96% accuracy, my experiments would sometimes improve accuracy and sometimes worsen accuracy, and I had to run the model several times to determine which.
